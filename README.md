learning-solidity-2018

These examples are part of my guide The best way to become Ethereum Developer in 2018

and 30/30 challenge on polish ethereum programming FB group (members write one contract a day to improve Solidity skills).

In Ethereum world everything is changing dynamically. I decided to make a set of Smart Contracts for learning purposes.

I know it's funny to name a repo this way but I am quite convinced that in 2019 these examples may not work with the latest Solidity.

Try to write a contract yourself before checking the code in the repo!
Examples
01_say_hello.sol

    set greeting on creation and allow to change it by the owner (creator of the contract)
    return greeting to everyone who calls sayHello method
    return Hello Daddy to the creator

02_balance_address_checker.sol

    return address of the contract
    return address of the contract's owner
    return address of the sender
    return balance of the contract
    return balance of the contract's owner (ONLY if you are the owner)
    return balance of the sender

03_basic_random.sol

    return random number 0-99
    the "financial importance" of this calculation is less than miner would get for mining single block
    https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/419/when-can-blockhash-be-safely-used-for-a-random-number-when-would-it-be-unsafe?noredirect=1&lq=1

04_lottery_10_users.sol

    10 users limit
    user has to pay 0.1 ether to join the lottery
    same user can join once
    owner of the contract can join the lottery
    when 10 users join then the winner is picked
    winner receives all the money
    new lottery starts when the winner is pickecd

05_lottery_no_limit.sol

    user has to pay 0.1 ether to join the lottery
    no limit for users number
    same user can join multiple times
    owner of the contract can join too
    owner decides when to pick the winner
    winner receives all the money
    new lottery starts when the winner is pickecd

06_lottery_muliple_winners

    no limit for users
    user joins paying 0.1 eth and picking number 1-100
    owner decides when to generate random number (1-100)
    users who picked generated numbers win
    0.5 of the prize is distributed to all winners
    next lottery can start

07_fundraising

    fundraising has the goal to reach (amount is set on creation)
    fundraising has the time limit (time is set on creation)
    anyone can add any amount until time is up or the goal is reached
    when the time is up but the goal is not reached users can withdraw their funds
    when the goal is reached owner can withdraw all the money

08_basic_token

    intial supply of tokens is set on creation
    contract creator gets initial tokens
    tokens can be transferred to any account
    there is a protection from overflow
    everyone can check balances

09_ERC_20_token

    implement ERC20 token based on the EIP specification

10_ERC_721_token

    implement ERC721 token based on the EIP specification

Contribution

    feel to free to add new challenges in the README.
    feel free to add your solution to any challenge (of course if it's different than the existing one)

Example:

If you want to add another Basic Token contract:

    Fork the repo
    Add basic_token_b.sol to the 07_basic_token directory
    Make a PR
    Let me review it and merge it
    Enjoy having a nice contribution to the great project :)
